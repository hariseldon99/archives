This Source Tree Contains proggies for evaluating classical and quantum surfaces of section for 2 bosons in a double well. The double well is of the type:
V(x)= V0 * ( -2 * x^2 + x^4 )

The interaction between the particles:

1. classical poincare section:
A normalized gaussian of amplitude U0 and spread SIGMA, and a delta function:
U(x1,x2) = U0/SQRT(2*Pi*SIGMA) * EXP(-(x1-x2)^2/(2 * SIGMA^2))

2. quantum poincare section:
A delta function of amplitude U0:
U(x1,x2) = U0 DELTA(x1-x2)
The quantum surface of section is a husimi plot of a particular quantum state, performed by a simple finite element method using the particle in a box as a representation.

The relevant parameters are set by the header file "params.h". Edit them as necessary

Be sure to edit the Makefile to point to thelocation of the GNU Scientific libraries, as well as the compiler program.

The programs are compiled thus:
1."make poincare" compiles the poincare section program
2."make husimi" compiles the husimi function program
