The objective of this proposal is the study of the dynamics of Coarsening in Classical and Quantum Systems. It involves the study of classical and quantum many body systems, as well as field theories, as the systems they represent are quenched by the diabatic variation of a confining parameter. The dynamical processes that support re-equilibration constitute coarsening. The study will be performed using both analytical and numerical techniques, requiring the use of high performance parallel processors. The first part of the project entails the study of coarsening in classical quenches within a closed $\phi^4$-field theory, and the profiling of universal dynamical behavior expected in both critical and sub-critical quenches. The next phase will involve classical open systems with a more microscopic description; post-quenched coarsening in a classical array of micromagnets governed by Gilbert-Landau Lifshitz dynamics. The results obtained therein will be used to guide a deeper understanding of coarsening in 
quantum systems. The project will proceed to investigate coarsening and quenches in open quantum spin systems, both using a complete Hamiltonian description of the system+reservoir, as well as stochastic treatments of the reservoir using Lindblad superoperators. The project aims to understand a very important feature of nonequilibrium dynamics, and the onset of universality therein. The results will prove useful in multiple disciplines where the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of many body systems are studied.
