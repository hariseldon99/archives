\begin{acknowledgments}		% Optional
\index{Acknowledgments@\emph{Acknowledgments}}%
I am indebted to my advisor, Linda Reichl, for her guidance, support and patience. When I approached her expressing interest in the dynamics of cold atom systems, her previous research in this area provided invaluable insights and resulted in quickly specifying the problems tackled in this dissertation. She has given me considerable latitude and freedom in my research, and supported it intellectually and financially. Errors and misconceptions were efficiently identified and corrected, thanks in no small part to her penetrating critiques and extensive expertise in these areas. Her guidance led this research to be deemed valuable to the scientific community, and resulted in considerable satisfaction on our part at the completion of this work.

I am also grateful to the assistance of Dr. Kyungsun Na at the Center for Complex Quantum systems. Her research work in the dynamics of quantum control in molecular systems was the stepping stone that set us on the journey into the problems tackled here in this dissertation. The numerical tools and techniques that she developed were of great help with these problems. I would also like to take this opportunity to extend my gratitude to Dr. Benjamin P Holder. His works regarding the dynamics of noninteracting cold atom systems were the shoulders of the giant from which this bird flew to the skies. My thanks also extend to Professors Dicus, MacDonald, and Niu here at UT for their courses, and to Professor Mark Raizen for his critical eye and knowledge that was of considerable help. Annie Harding at the Center for Complex Quantum Systems has always provided me with reliable assistance in going through the red tape.

In order to reach this point in my academic life, I have gone through many stepping stones. At each stage, obstacles were encountered and surmounted as part of a rich tapestry of science and intellect that has been a vital part of my life. This treatise would be woefully incomplete without acknowledging those teachers that have informed and inspired my interest in physics, and provided me with the experience and background needed to get this far. My thanks go out to Professor Soumitra 'Akuda' Sengupta (formerly) of Jadavpur University, Calcutta, whose superlative introductory and intermediate courses in statistical mechanics were where I was taught almost everything that I needed to know in order to get started, not just basic principles but the right frame of mind and attitude needed to solve problems. I cannot over-stress his influence as a great teacher, and his enormous passion for physics that excited and inspired so many of his students, including myself. 

In addition, I happily acknowledge the influence of Professor Jayanta Bhattacharjee of the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, Calcutta, for introducing me to the world of the dynamics of complex systems and chaos, as well as the world of cutting-edge research in these areas. I would also like to thank Professor Sreerup Raychaudhuri of the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, whose courses in quantum mechanics and field theory were to me what Akuda's courses were in statistical mechanics. His instruction, as well as moral support, got me through some difficult times. Also, my thanks to Professor Debashish Chowdhuri of I.I.T. Kanpur for his difficult but informative course on advanced statistical mechanics.

Lastly, I would like to thank my parents, my father, Professor Probir Roy and  mother, Professor Manashi Roy (retd). My father, a particle physicist, was my primary influence in all things. He taught me all the fundamental physics that I know. My mother has supported me at every turn and her love kept me going.

The dynamics of mesoscopic two-boson systems that model an interacting pair of ultracold alkali atoms in the presence of electromagnetic potentials are considered. The translational degrees of freedom of such a system can be described by a simple reduced atom Hamiltonian. Introducing time modulations in the laser fields causes parametric variations of the Hamiltonian's Floquet eigenvalue spectrum. Broken symmetries cause level repulsion and avoided crossings in this spectrum that are quantum manifestations of the chaos in the underlying classical dynamics of the systems. We investigate the effects of this phenomenon in the coherent control of excitations in these systems. These systems can be coherently excited from their ground states to higher energy states via a Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP). The presence of avoided crossings alter the outcome of STIRAP. First, the classical dynamics of such two-boson systems in double wells is described and manifestations of the same to the quantum mechanical system are discussed. Second, the quantum dynamics of coherent control in the manner discussed above is detailed for a select choice(s) of system parameters. Finally, the same chaos-assisted adiabatic passage is demonstrated for optical lattice systems based on experiments on the same done with noninteracting atoms.
