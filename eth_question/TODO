1. Figure out the bug in eth_davg/eth_eavg that's causing negative values of density matrix elements
   To do this, remove forbiddenness and run the code for lattice_size=3, vector_size=1
   If |m> is a basis vector, then b_j |m> = \delta_{jm}|vacuum>
   Analytical formula for avg(b^\dagger_i b_j) is possible:
   avg(b^\dagger_i b_j)  = \sum_\a |<a|\psi_0>|^2 U_{ai} U_{aj}
   Compared python evaluation with numerics to see where it is going wrong
   
   Update: 
   Now using absolute value of the expression for momentum density in supplementary
   rigol doi:10.1038/nature06838. May be wrong though.

2. Large problem sizes (5 X 5 lattice , 5 particles) takes 4 days for Hamilt to build and still not dump 
   any output for 3 days since). REALLY need to reduce redundant calculations...
3. Write code for evolving this system dynamically
