==Source Codes==

The following source codes are a part of the repository.

===Testing the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH)===

Replicated the problem given in [http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature06838 doi:10.1038/nature06838] for given lattice size, then tests ETH by Lyapunov dynamics.

===Driven disordered Ising Model===

A time dependent many body problem of the Ising model in 1 dimension with disorder modelled by random numbers being driven in time. The system is integrated numerically for multiple disorder configurations.

===Anisotropic Graphene===

Code to diagonalize the Hamiltonian of an anisotropic Graphene system.

===Non-Equilibrium quantum quenched dynamics of BCS systems===

A momentum space ensemble of tls systems simulating a BCS gas, with a self-consistent time-dependent superfluid gap.

===Temporal evolution of Coherent Matter Waves in Bose Fermi Mixtures===

Numerical evolution of the coupled Gross-Pitaevski/Landau-Ginzburg dynamics of a Bose-Fermi mixture in a 3D trap.

===Full Schroedinger dynamics of the STIRAP problem===

Floquet analysis of the time evolution of two interacting bosons in the following potentials:

 # Quartic double well (with dipole excitations)

 # Optical lattice (with multiple resonances and frequency modulated excitations)

===Floquet analysis of the STIRAP problem=== 

Floquet analysis of the time evolution of two interacting bosons in the following potentials:

 # Quartic double well (with dipole excitations)

 # Optical lattice (with multiple resonances and frequency modulated excitations)

===Classical and Quantum Poincare maps===

Poincare and Husimi cross sections for 2 interacting particles in a double well are calculated.
